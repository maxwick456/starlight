Game types include ring shot (where you must shoot the ball through golden hoops that are suspended above the play area, gaining bonus points as you play), bomb tennis (simply put Tennis with Bombs) and Piranha Challenge (much like the tennis machines which chuck balls at you, but in this case they are replaced with Piranha plants). Of course, there is your normal tournament mode, with up to 4 players in on the action, and some crazy arenas, especially Bowser's Castle, which is suspended above a lava pit!",

The only true worry people have is the Empire, whose leaders are looking to revive the great force once known as 'magic'. The Empire had heard word of the remains of a mystical being, known as 'Esper', being found in the mining town of Narshe. Quickly, three soldiers were dispatched to find this Esper and bring it to the Emperor. One of the soldiers, a young girl, triggers a power in the Esper that initiates a dangerous series of events. The only ones who can help her are a rag-tag band of rebels and heroes, who offer their very hearts and souls to save the world from the mad plans of the Empire.",

All the levels have the same themes to them they originally had, but with new layouts and enemy placement, I also wanted to keep the classic feel to it, which is why I used mostly graphics from CV2 and 3. There are very few custom graphics in the hack, I’m not good with graphics at all, but I did make a new title screen using the new CV logo (Which Moonchile later enhanced) and enhanced some of the orignal sprits. Any Castlevania fan will probably like this, but until recently I didn’t notice it’s one downside: It’s hard. As I made this hack I pretty much learned how everything in CV’s game engine works, the exact timing of enemies and such. So, while I can play through most of it with no problems even my friends who are good at Castlevania die several times on the first level.

However New York City has suddenly become a very haunted place, and the number of ghosts has suddenly and dramatically increased. The Ghostbusters must reduce the paranormal psychokinetic energy, the 'PK level' in the city, which represents ghost power, before the Temple of Zuul awakens and resurrects an evil goddess called Gozer.",
